Followed the tutorials of 
"https://www.serverless.com/blog/flask-serverless-api-in-aws-lambda-the-easy-way" & 
"https://medium.com/hackernoon/using-aws-dynamodb-with-flask-9086c541e001"

Goal:
- Originally was to upload an Angular project to Lambda but ran into several issues.
- Switched to Python-Flask due to simplicity.
